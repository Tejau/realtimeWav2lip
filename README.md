# Wav2Lip: Lip-Syncing real-Time Audio with Images

## Introduction

Wave2Lip revolutionizes the realm of audio-visual synchronization with its groundbreaking real-time audio to video conversion capability. Powered by cutting-edge deep learning techniques, Wave2Lip accurately lip-syncs videos to any target speech in real-time, seamlessly aligning audio with visual content. This project leverages PyAudio for audio processing, Flask for server-side implementation, and a sophisticated inference mechanism that efficiently applies lip-syncing on images. Wave2Lip offers a user-friendly solution for generating lip movements from audio inputs, opening up possibilities for enhanced communication, entertainment, and creative expression.
